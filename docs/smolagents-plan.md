# Simple Agentic System with SmoLAgents

## Overview
Building a simple agentic system using Hugging Face's `smolagents` library to learn core concepts of agent-based systems.

## What is SmoLAgents?
SmoLAgents is a lightweight framework for building AI agents that can:
- Use tools and functions
- Maintain conversation context
- Execute multi-step reasoning
- Integrate with various LLMs

## Learning Goals
1. Understand agent architecture and tool usage
2. Implement basic agent workflows
3. Learn to create custom tools
4. Practice agent orchestration patterns

## Simple Project Ideas

### 1. File Manager Agent
- **Tools**: File operations (read, write, list, search)
- **Capabilities**: Organize files, search content, create summaries
- **Learning focus**: Tool creation and file system interaction

### 2. Code Helper Agent
- **Tools**: Code analysis, documentation generation, testing
- **Capabilities**: Review code, suggest improvements, generate docs
- **Learning focus**: Multi-step reasoning and code understanding

### 3. Research Assistant Agent
- **Tools**: Web search, document processing, summarization
- **Capabilities**: Gather information, synthesize findings, create reports
- **Learning focus**: Information retrieval and synthesis

## Recommended Starting Point: File Manager Agent

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Tools
1. Install smolagents
2. Create basic file tools (read, write, list)
3. Implement simple agent that can manage files

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities
1. Add search and filtering tools
2. Implement content analysis
3. Add file organization features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Batch operations
2. Workflow automation
3. Integration with external services

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Install smolagents and dependencies
3. Create first simple agent
4. Test with basic file operations
